This ongoing project aims to develop a novel metric to quantify an author's influence in the narrative braiding process by comparing the final braided narrative against the individual author's contribution in terms of the Overlap-Unique-Conflict clauses extracted by the CAMPeN framework.

Overview of Project "TI"
======
This project focused on developing a novel metric for quantifying author influence in the context of narrative braiding, which is largely an unexplored research area till now. By definition, a braided narrative is created from the contributions of multiple authors. For this thrust, we also assume that there is a separate entity called the editorial board that polishes and edits the raw contributions of individual authors and is in charge of creating the final braided narrative. Under these assumptions, we consider three scenarios for quantifying author influence: 1) Quantify Author Influence for Single Author Contribution - Single Braided Narrative Scenario, 2) Quantify Author Influence for Multiple Authors - Single Braided Narrative Scenario, and 3) Quantify Author Influence for Multiple Authors - Multiple Braided Narratives Scenario. Another basic idea here is that influential authors become more trustworthy over time and serve as reliable sources in the future.

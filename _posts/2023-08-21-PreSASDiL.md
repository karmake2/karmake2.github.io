This is an ongoing project where we are developing conversational AI techniques which are capable of acquiring new predictive skills on the fly through intuitive, natural conversations using self-directed learning.


Overview of Project "PreSASDiL"
======
In this project, we are utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to build a natural language interface between humans and the AutoML tools (like Scikit-Learn), which, in turn, facilitates acquiring new prediction skills via self-directed learning. The core technical challenges we are addressing in this project are the following: 

<ol>
<li>Accurately understand and define the goal skill(s) to acquire (as defined by a human)</li>
    
<li>Formulate a precise and relevant Machine Learning (ML) task.</li>
    
<li>Curate data sets and assign model hyper-parameters accordingly.</li>
    
<li>Train AutoML models to learn the skill.</li>

<li>Apply the skill effectively.</li>

</ol>

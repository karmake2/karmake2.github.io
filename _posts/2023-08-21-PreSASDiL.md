This is an ongoing project where we are developing conversational AI techniques that are capable of acquiring new predictive skills on the fly through intuitive, natural conversations using self-directed learning.


Overview of Project "Ad-Hoc Predictive Skill Acquisition"
======
A big challenge in democratizing AI is that no single AI model is guaranteed to be skilled in all possible tasks a user may want to perform. Therefore, being able to learn new skills on an ad hoc basis is essential. To address this challenge, we are developing conversational AI techniques that are capable of acquiring new predictive skills on the fly through intuitive, natural conversations using self-directed learning. More specifically, we are utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to build a natural language interface between humans and the AutoML tools (like Scikit-Learn), which, in turn, facilitates acquiring new prediction skills via self-directed learning. The core technical challenges we are addressing in this project are the following: 

<ol>
<li>Accurately understand and define the goal skill(s) to acquire (as defined by a human)</li>
    
<li>Formulate a precise and relevant Machine Learning (ML) task.</li>
    
<li>Curate data sets and assign model hyper-parameters accordingly.</li>
    
<li>Train AutoML models to learn the skill.</li>

<li>Apply the skill effectively.</li>

</ol>

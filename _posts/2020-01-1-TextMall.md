The objective of this research is to develop a general-purpose text analytics platform, i.e., Text-Mall, which would enable real-world users to easily explore the power of Text-Mining in a simple and interactive fashion without worrying about the underlying details of Natural Language Processing. For details, please check the link above.



Overview of Project TextMall
======
The Text-Mall platform consists of two primary components: 1) Framework: a general intuitive framework that can support simple and interactive Text-Mining for real users. 2) Language: an operator-based text mining language, that can allow a user to flexibly specify potentially many different Text-Mining tasks / workflows.

Here is an example use-case of TextMall agent:

This is the high level architecture of TextMall agent:

Impact of Project TextMall
======
Text Data not only contains human's observed (objective) information about the world, but also their subjective opinions, making text data an extremely useful resource for discovering (and understanding) people's attitudes, opinions and preferences, which is needed in optimizing all kinds of decisions related to people, ranging from making effective and acceptable public policies by governments, to deciding critical medical treatment for patients by doctors, to providing personalized tutoring materials to students by teachers, and/or to effective advertising of products to people on the Internet by companies. Text-Mall, once realized, will enable real world users to conduct such analysis and thus, facilitate more informed decision-making process for them.

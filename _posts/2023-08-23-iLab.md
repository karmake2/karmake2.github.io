"iLab'' is an ongoing project in my lab, where we are developing an artificial intelligence-based meta-conversational framework to create dialog-based interactive laboratory experiences for middle school science students and teachers in the context of simulation-based science experiments.

Overview of Project "Knowledge Grounding via Meta-Conversation"
======
For specialized dialog systems, a big challenge for ensuring proper knowledge grounding is that only the end user knows what kind of conversations they want. Therefore, the ideal solution must either be an "oracle'' that can read the user's mind or engage in a conversation with the user about their expectations and necessary background information before the actual conversation happens. In other words, a "Conversation about Conversation'', i.e., a "Meta-Conversation'' should happen with the user to facilitate proper Knowledge Grounding. One such project ongoing in our group is ``iLab'', where we are developing an Artificial Intelligence-based Conversational Framework to create dialog-based interactive laboratory experiences for middle school science students and teachers in the context of simulation-based science experiments. A key component of the framework is an intelligent conversational agent (SimPal) that actively learns from teachers through a "Meta-Conversation'' to solicit their instructional goals associated with simulation experiments and store them using a computational representation. In other words, the school teacher actively teaches the machine/agent what the instructional goals are for a particular scientific experiment in plain natural language. The agent then uses this representation to facilitate and mediate an interactive knowledge-grounded conversation (powered by state-of-the-art Large Language Models) with students as they run experiments to enhance their learning experience. Unlike existing intelligent tutoring systems and pedagogical conversational agents, SimPal can work with any off-the-shelf third-party simulations, a unique feature of this project enabled by our proposed Meta-Conversation technique.

"iLab'' is an ongoing project in my lab, where we are developing an artificial intelligence-based conversational framework to create dialog-based interactive laboratory experiences for middle school science students and teachers in the context of simulation-based science experiments.

Overview of Project "iLab"
======
The goal of this project is to develop a conversational, artificial intelligence-based ecosystem (iLab). Using advanced natural language understanding techniques, the intelligent agent at the center of the iLab ecosystem—SimPal—will work with middle school science teachers and students to provide a dialog-based interactive laboratory experience in the context of simulation-based science experiments. A key component of the framework is an intelligent conversational agent (SimPal) that engages with teachers in a dialog to solicit their instructional goals associated with simulation experiments and store them using a computational representation. The agent then uses this representation to facilitate and mediate an interactive dialog (powered by state-of-the-art large language models) with students as they run experiments to enhance their learning experience. The agent proactively asks students reflection questions, provide them with real-time customized feedback, tracks students' progress, and then analyzes their responses and reports back to the teacher. Unlike existing intelligent tutoring systems and pedagogical conversational agents, SimPal can work with any off-the-shelf third-party simulations, a unique feature of this project.

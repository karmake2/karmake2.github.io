What if an AI agent can serve you as your personal data scientist? Isn't that cool? For details, please check the link above.



Overview of Project VIDS (a conversational AI agent to help with Data Science Tasks)
======
A number of vital steps of the machine learning pipeline, including understanding the attributes of domain-specific data, defining prediction problems, creating a suitable training data set, and selecting a promising machine learning technique, tend to be done manually by a data scientist or a machine learning engineer on an ad-hoc basis. In this project, we are developing a Virtual Interactive Data Scientist (or VIDS), an intelligent agent, to remove the aforementioned bottlenecks and automate the entire machine learning pipeline as maximally as possible. VIDS is an intelligent agent that can formulate different prediction tasks and automatically recommend the best ones to its users.

Here is an example use-case of VIDS agent:

This is the high level architecture of VIDS agent:

Impact of Project VIDS 
======
VIDS will communicate with users like a human data scientist and quickly understand their needs. It will translate these needs into well-defined prediction tasks. In Summary, VIDS will enable end-users (machine learning non-experts) to interactively play with infinite combinations of different prediction tasks and AutoML models by tweaking a minimal number of hyper-parameters and task preferences.

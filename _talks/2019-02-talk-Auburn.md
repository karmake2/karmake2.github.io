I will introduce Influence Models for both Information Thirst (JIM) as well as for Content Generation (ITG), respectively, in this talk.

======

A crucial component of any intelligent system is to understand and predict the behavior of its users. A correct model of the user behavior enables the system to perform effectively to better serve the users need. While much work has been done on user behavior modeling based on historical activity data, little attention has been paid to how external factors influence the user behavior, which is clearly important for improving an intelligent system. The influence of external factors on user behavior are mostly reflected in two different ways: 1) Through significant growth of usersâ€™ thirst about information related to the external factors (e.g., user may conduct a lot of search related to a popular event), and 2) Through the user generated contents that are directly/indirectly related to the external factors (e.g. user may tweet about a particular event). To capture these two aspects of user behavior, I will introduce Influence Models for both Information Thirst (JIM) as well as for Content Generation (ITG), respectively, in this talk. I will also demonstrate the huge potentials of JIM and ITG in terms of their power to model user behavior more accurately as well as their ability to provide us with novel data mining tools.

Monirul Islam, Kazuyuki Murase"	Towards better generalization in Pittsburgh learning classifier systems	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	"Generalization ability of a classifier is an important issue for any classification task. This paper proposes a new evolutionary system, i.e., EDARIC, based on the Pittsburgh approach for evolutionary machine learning and classification. The new system uses a destructive approach that starts with large-sized rules and gradually decreases the sizes as evolution progresses. Unlike most previous works, EDARIC adopts an intelligent deletion mechanism, evolves a separate population for each class of a given problem and uses an ensemble system to classify unknown instances. These features help in avoiding over-fitting and class-imbalance problems, which are beneficial for improving generalization ability of a classification system. EDARIC also applies a rule post-processing step to exempt the evolution phase from the burden of tuning a large number of parameters. Experimental results on various benchmark classification problems reveal that EDARIC has better generalization ability in case of both standard and imbalanced datasets compared to many existing algorithms in the literature"	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2014/CEC_EDARIC.pdf	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2014/EDARIC_Presenation.pptx	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2014/CEC_EDARIC.png

Monirul Islam, Kazuyuki Murase"	Forecasting time series - A layered ensemble architecture	IJCNN	"Time series forecasting (TSF) have been widely used in many application areas such as science, engineering and finance. The characteristics of phenomenon generating a series are usually unknown and information available for forecasting is only limited to the past values of the series. It is, therefore, necessary to use an appropriate number of past values, termed lag, for forecasting. This paper presents a layered ensemble architecture (LEA) for TSF problems. Our architecture is consisted of two layers, each of which uses an ensemble of neural networks. Unlike most previous studies on TSF, LEA puts emphasis on both accuracy and diversity among individual networks in an ensemble. While the ensemble of the first layer tries to find an appropriate lag of a given time series, it of the second layer makes forecasting using the obtained lag. The use of the appropriate lag signifies LEA's effort in producing accurate networks for constructing the ensemble. In order to maintain diversity among networks in the ensemble, LEA trains each network in the ensemble using a different training set. The proposed architecture uses a clustering based selection method that considers both accuracy and diversity in selecting networks to construct the ensemble. Accuracy is maintained here by selecting the best networks from each cluster. On the other hand, diversity is ensured by using the variance information in constructing clusters. LEA has been tested extensively on the time series data sets of NN3 competition. In terms of prediction accuracy, our experimental results have showed clearly that LEA is better than other ensemble and non-ensemble algorithms."	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2014/IJCNN_TSF.pdf		https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2014/IJCNN_TSF.png
10/1/2016	"Shubhra Kanti Karmaker Santu, Parikshit Sondhi, ChengXiang Zhai"	Generative Feature Language Models for Mining Implicit Features from Customer Reviews	ACM CIKM	"Online customer reviews are very useful for both helping consumers make buying decisions on products or services and providing business intelligence. However, it is a challenge for people to manually digest all the opinions buried in large amounts of review data, raising the need for automatic opinion summarization and analysis. One fundamental challenge in automatic opinion summarization and analysis is to mine implicit features, i.e., recognizing the features implicitly mentioned (referred to) in a review sentence. Existing approaches require many ad hoc manual parameter tuning, and are thus hard to optimize or generalize; their evaluation has only been done with Chinese review data. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on generative feature language models that can mine the implicit features more effectively through unsupervised statistical learning. The parameters are optimized automatically using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We also created eight new data sets to facilitate evaluation of this task in English. Experimental results show that our proposed approach is very effective for assigning features to sentences that do not explicitly mention the features, and outperforms the existing algorithms by a large margin."	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2016/ImplicitFeatureMining.pdf	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2016/CIKMPresentationImplicitFeatures.pptx	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2016/ImplicitFeature.png

In this paper, we study how to model the influence of events on user queries by framing it as a novel data mining problem. Specifically, given a text description of an event, we mine the search log data to identify queries that are triggered by it and further characterize the temporal trend of influence created by the same event on user queries. We solve this data mining problem by proposing computational measures that quantify the influence of an event on a query to identify triggered queries and then, proposing a novel extension of Hawkes process to model the evolutionary trend of the influence of an event on search queries. Evaluation results using news articles and search log data show that the proposed approach is effective for identification of queries triggered by events reported in news articles and characterization of the influence trend over time, opening up many interesting opportunities of applications such as comparative analysis of influential events and prediction of event-triggered queries by users."	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2017/InfluenceModeling.pdf	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2017/WWWPresentation.pptx	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2017/JIM1.png

ACM SIGIR	"E-Commerce (E-Com) search is an emerging important new application of information retrieval. Learning to Rank (LETOR) is a general effective strategy for optimizing search engines, and is thus also a key technology for E-Com search. While the use of LETOR for web search has been well studied, its use for E-Com search has not yet been well explored. In this paper, we discuss the practical challenges in applying learning to rank methods to E-Com search, including the challenges in feature representation, obtaining reliable relevance judgments, and optimally exploiting multiple user feedback signals such as click rates, add-to-cart ratios, order rates, and revenue. We study these new challenges using experiments on industry data sets and report several interesting findings that can provide guidance on how to optimally apply LETOR to E-Com search: First, popularity-based features defined solely on product items are very useful and LETOR methods were able to effectively optimize their combination with relevance-based features. Second, query attribute sparsity raises challenges for LETOR, and selecting features to reduce/avoid sparsity is beneficial. Third, while crowdsourcing is often useful for obtaining relevance judgments for Web search, it does not work as well for E-Com search due to difficulty in eliciting sufficiently fine grained relevance judgments. Finally, among the multiple feedback signals, the order rate is found to be the most robust training objective, followed by click rate, while add-to-cart ratio seems least robust, suggesting that an effective practical strategy may be to initially use click rates for training and gradually shift to using order rates as they become available."	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2017/LETOR_ECOM.pdf	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2017/SIGIRPresentation.pptx	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2017/Ecom.png
10/1/2017	"Yiren Wang, Dominic Seyler, Shubhra Kanti Karmaker Santu, ChengXiang Zhai"	A Study of Feature Construction for Text-based Forecasting of Time Series Variables. 	ACM CIKM [Short Paper] 	"Time series are ubiquitous in the world since they are used to measure various phenomena (e.g., temperature, spread of a virus, sales, etc.). Forecasting of time series is highly beneficial (and necessary) for optimizing decisions, yet is a very challenging problem; using only the historical values of the time series is often insufficient. In this paper, we study how to construct effective additional features based on related text data for time series forecasting. Besides the commonly used n-gram features, we propose a general strategy for constructing multiple topical features based on the topics discovered by a topic model. We evaluate feature effectiveness using a data set for predicting stock price changes where we constructed additional features from news text articles for stock market prediction. We found that: 1) Text-based features outperform time series-based features, suggesting the great promise of leveraging text data for improving time series forecasting. 2) Topic-based features are not very effective stand-alone, but they can further improve performance when added on top of n-gram features. 3) The best topic-based feature appears to be a long-term aggregation of topics over time with high weights on recent topics."	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2017/sp0985-wangA.pdf	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2017/CIKM2017-poster.pdf	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2017/TimeSeries.png

WPES@ACM CCS	"The promise of big data relies on the release and aggregation of data sets. When these data sets contain sensitive information about individuals, it has been scalable and convenient to protect the privacy of these individuals by de-identification. However, studies show that the combination of de-identified data sets with other data sets risks re-identification of some records. Some studies have shown how to measure this risk in specific contexts where certain types of public data sets (such as voter roles) are assumed to be available to attackers. To the extent that it can be accomplished, such analyses enable the threat of compromises to be balanced against the benefits of sharing data. For example, a study that might save lives by enabling medical research may be enabled in light of a sufficiently low probability of compromise from sharing de-identified data. In this paper, we introduce a general probabilistic re-identification framework that can be instantiated in specific contexts to estimate the probability of compromises based on explicit assumptions. We further propose a baseline of such assumptions that enable a first-cut estimate of risk for practical case studies. We refer to the framework with these assumptions as the Naive Re-identification Framework (NRF). As a case study, we show how we can apply NRF to analyze and quantify the risk of re-identification arising from releasing de-identified medical data in the context of publicly-available social media data. The results of this case study show that NRF can be used to obtain meaningful quantification of the re-identification risk, compare the risk of different social media, and assess risks of combinations of various demographic attributes and medical conditions that individuals may voluntarily disclose on social media."	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2018/NRF.pdf	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2018/NRF.pptx	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2018/NRF.png
10/1/2018	"Shubhra Kanti Karmaker Santu, Liangda Li, Yi Chang, ChengXiang Zhai"	JIM: Joint Influence Modeling for Collective Search Behavior. 	ACM CIKM	"Previous work has shown that popular trending events are important external factors which pose significant influence on user search behavior and also provided a way to computationally model this influence. However, their problem formulation was based on the strong assumption that each event poses its influence independently. This assumption is unrealistic as there are many correlated events in the real world which influence each other and thus, would pose a joint influence on the user search behavior rather than posing influence independently. In this paper, we study this novel problem of Modeling the Joint Influences posed by multiple correlated events on user search behavior. We propose a Joint Influence Model based on the Multivariate Hawkes Process which captures the inter-dependency among multiple events in terms of their influence upon user search behavior. We evaluate the proposed Joint Influence Model using two months query-log data from https://search.yahoo.com/. Experimental results show that the model can indeed capture the temporal dynamics of the joint influence over time and also achieves superior performance over different baseline methods when applied to solve various interesting prediction problems as well as real-word application scenarios, e.g., query auto-completion."	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2018/Multivariate_Influence.pdf	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2018/JIM.pptx	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2018/JIM2.png

Searsmith, Chengxiang Zhai"	SOFSAT: Towards a Setlike Operator based Framework for Semantic Analysis of Text.	ACM SIGKDD Explorations [Position Paper] 	"As data reported by humans about our world, text data play a very important role in all data mining applications, yet how to develop a general text analysis system to support all text mining applications is a difficult challenge. In this position paper, we introduce SOFSAT, a new framework that can support set-like operators for semantic analysis of natural text data with variable text representations. It includes three basic set-like operators-TextIntersect, Tex-tUnion, and TextDifference-that are analogous to the corresponding set operators intersection, union, and difference, respectively, which can be applied to any representation of text data, and different representations can be combined via transformation functions that map text to and from any representation. Just as the set operators can be flexibly combined iteratively to construct arbitrary subsets or supersets based on some given sets, we show that the corresponding text analysis operators can also be combined flexibly to support a wide range of analysis tasks that may require different workflows, thus enabling an application developer to ""program"" a text mining application by using SOFSAT as an application programming language for text analysis. We discuss instantiations and implementation strategies of the framework with some specific examples, present ideas about how the framework can be implemented by exploiting/extending existing techniques, and provide a roadmap for future research in this new direction."	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2018/SOFSAT.pdf		https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2018/SOFSAT.png

Arxiv [Preprint] 	"Most automation in machine learning focuses on model selection and hyper parameter tuning, and many overlook the challenge of automatically defining predictive tasks. We still heavily rely on human experts to define prediction tasks, and generate labels by aggregating raw data. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of defining useful prediction problems on event-driven time-series data. We introduce MLFriend to address this challenge. MLFriend first generates all possible prediction tasks under a predefined space, then interacts with a data scientist to learn the context of the data and recommend good prediction tasks from all the tasks in the space. We evaluate our system on three different datasets and generate a total of 2885 prediction tasks and solve them. Out of these 722 were deemed useful by expert data scientists. We also show that an automatic prediction task discovery system is able to identify top 10 tasks that a user may like within a batch of 100 tasks."	https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2019/MLFriend.pdf		https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2019/MLFriend.png

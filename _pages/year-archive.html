My long-term research goal is centered around the following question: "How can we make AI/Data Science more <em>accessible</em> and <em>useful</em> to the end users in order to <em>democratize AI</em> to a wider audience?" As a researcher, I find myself at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR), with a broad interest in the general area of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (see Figure below).<br><br>


Even though Artificial Intelligence (AI) has existed for a long time, its broad accessibility is a recent development, thanks to ChatGPT for its human-like interactions. While such broad accessibility provides a great opportunity to <em>democratize AI</em> across general people, it comes with several key risks and challenges, including but not limited to, lack of Knowledge Grounding/Contextual Understanding, an abundance of Biased Contents/Narratives, and lack of Utility-Centric Evaluation of AI systems. As such, my current research focuses on these three specific challenges (see Figure below), i.e., 1) Narrative Debiasing, 2) Knowledge Grounding and 3) Utility-Centric Evaluation of NLP/IR Systems. Additionally, I plan to grow my research program into the following emerging areas related to democratization of AI: <em>Energy Efficient NLP</em> and <em>Conversational Software Testing</em>.

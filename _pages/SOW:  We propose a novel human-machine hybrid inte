SOW:  We propose a novel human-machine hybrid intelligence framework, CAMPeN: “Collaborative Analytics of Multi-Perspective Narratives”, where the AI machine will first generate candidate clauses from each input narrative pair w.r.t. Overlap-Unique-Conflict criteria separately, and then the humans  crowd-workers) will perform as active judges to verify these generated candidate clauses in a distributed fashion. Finally, the verified clauses will simply be combined by the machine to construct the ultimate Overlap-Unique-Conflict style summary, which will be presented in front of the user. The major benefits of the proposed CAMPeN framework is two-fold: 1) it will enable domain experts in fields other than machine learning/NLP (e.g., a military general) to quickly dig out/verify interesting hypotheses from multiple alternative narratives/descriptions without worrying about the underlying computational techniques, and 2) it will help quickly verify facts and claims about real-world events by analyzing alternative narratives and verifying critical information at scale.

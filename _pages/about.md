My name is Shubhra Kanti Karmaker ("Santu"). I am a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in the department of [Computer Science and Software Enginering](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/comp/) at Auburn University, Alabama. My primary research interest lies at the intersection of Big Data, Artifical Intelligence and Natural Language Processing. Before joining Auburn University, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu/) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), hosted by [Dr. Kalyan Veeramachaneni](https://kalyan.lids.mit.edu/). Prior to joining MIT, I completed my Ph.D. in computer science from University of Illinois Urbana Champaign (UIUC) under the supervision of [Prof. ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/).

My name is Shubhra Kanti Karmaker ("Santu"). I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu/) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), currently hosted by [Dr. Kalyan Veeramachaneni](https://kalyan.lids.mit.edu/). My primary research interest lies at the intersection of Big Data and Applied machine learning. Prior to joining MIT, I completed my Ph.D. in computer science from University of Illinois Urbana Champaign (UIUC) under the supervision of [Prof. ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/). I will be joining as a tenure-track assistant professor in the department of computer science at Auburn University, Alabama from Spring 2020.

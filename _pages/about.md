My name is Shubhra Kanti Karmaker ("Santu"). I am a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in the Department of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/) at the University of Central Florida (UCF), and also affiliated with the [Institute of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.ucf.edu/) and [Learning Science Faculty Cluster](https://www.ucf.edu/research/learning-sciences/). My primary research interest lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval. I am also the founding director of the Bridge-AI Lab at UCF, where my students and I work on _creating bridges between the general public and AI tools in order to democratize AI beyond the tech-savvy communities_.

Before joining UCF, I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of [Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/comp/) at Auburn University, Alabama. Before joining Auburn University, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Before joining MIT, I completed my Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) under the supervision of [Prof. ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/). During my Ph.D., I also worked as a research intern at Microsoft Research (Summer 2017 and 2018), Yahoo Research (Summer 2016), and @WalmartLabs (Summer 2015).
